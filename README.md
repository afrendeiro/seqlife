### idea
- Get a [list of *-seq methods](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/seq/)
- Annotate with broad application class (DNA, RNA, DNA-protein interactions)
- Plot time agains citation number
- Identify dominant, "dying" and "stillbirth" methods overal or per class
- Identify which classes are dominated by only one method and which have more than one - correlate with method popularity (sum of cites for all methods within class) or age.
